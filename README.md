# TweetX

Welcome to the decentralized interface for mining tweets as NFTs. Our revolutionary project lets you convert and store any tweet as an NFT simply from its ID, offering a simplified user experience and seamless integration with OpenSea. It's the future of preserving digital cultural moments üöÄ.<br>

üê¶ Tweet it. Mint it. üê¶


## Overview 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Install
- Set the `REACT_APP_BEARER_TOKEN` and `REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variables
- Install the dependencies

`yarn install`

### Run 
- Run  to start the development server

`yarn start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- Connect your Goerli testnet wallet
- Provide a Tweet ID and click "Mint" button to mint that tweet as an NFT üöÄ !

## How it works 
TweetX is an interface that allows user to mint any tweet into NFTs. When clicked on the "Mint" button, the following steps are executed : 
- Takes a Tweet ID as input
- Fetches the tweet details from the Twitter API v2 JS
- Generates an image of tweet preview using an API
- Sends a prompt to ChatGPT to get a 3 words summary of the tweet
- Store the metadata and image on IPFS
- Mints an NFT on Goerli testnet with:
    - The tweet text as description
    - The tweet preview image
    - The 3 word summary as the NFT name
    - Various tweet metrics as attributes

### Technology used :

- React for the frontend
- Viem for interacting with Ethereum
- OpenZeppelin Contracts for the ERC1155 NFT contract
- IPFS for storing the NFT metadata
- Twitter and tweetpik API for fetching and generating tweet previews
ChatGPT API to summarize the tweet in 3 words
